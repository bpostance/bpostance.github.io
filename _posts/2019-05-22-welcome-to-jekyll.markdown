Hello and welcome to my new Research and DataScience portfolio page. On this site I'll be posting links to projects, demo's and training material on machine learning and data science, in addition to research article reviews and any other interesting updates. 

I have built this site using free hosting on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) and the open source site generator [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] written in Ruby. 

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Ben')
#=> prints 'Hi, Ben' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
