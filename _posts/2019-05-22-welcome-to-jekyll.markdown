Hello and welcome to my new Research and DataScience portfolio page. 
On this site I'll be posting links to projects, demo's and training material on machine learning and data science, in addition to research article reviews and any other interesting updates.
I already have lots of content in my various [github repo's](https://github.com/bpostance/training.data_science), and this is my attempy to curate this and new work.

I have built this site using free hosting on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) and the open source site generator [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] written in Ruby. 

I chose Jekyll as it posts can be written in html or in markdown such as Jupyter Notebooks. Which is great if you create notebooks in R or Python.
To add new posts you simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown`. 
Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Ben')
#=> prints 'Hi, Ben' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Jekyll also supports:
 - [Google Analytics](https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/)
 - [User comments with Just-comments](https://60devs.com/adding-comments-to-your-jekyll-blog.html) or [Discus](https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/).
 - [Displaying Jupyter notebooks](Display Jupyter Notebooks with Jekyll)
